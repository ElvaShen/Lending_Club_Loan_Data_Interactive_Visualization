# Lending Club Data Visualization Project

## Summary
The objective of this project is to understand trends of loan amount and gain insights through analyzing the Lending Club Loan Data from 2007 to 2015. The reason I chose this dataset was from my great interest in FinTech industry, and I believe learning what loan data looks like will help me better understand their business model and enhance my business acumen. I mainly used Python Plotly to generate interactive visualizations about the distribution of loan amount by state, by purpose and making comparison of borrowers' income. 

## Source Code
The code is in Jupyter Notebook format named `Lending_Club_Loan_Data_Interactive_Visualization.ipynb`.
